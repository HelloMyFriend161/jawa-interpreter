# jawa-interpreter
a language that i made.

this is supposed to be a joke language, kind of like the jaksel language that that one guy made.

i am probably not going to release any tutorials about this language, if you know lua then just look through the code and try understand the code. it kind of sucks but it's not my fault.

the syntax is similar to lua, but with slightly more freedom. you can literally code in a single line that stretches onto infinity.

- Instructions

to run your own jawa program, just install the parser.lua file and move it somewhere nice like in a folder, and then add a new file called skrip.jawa, although you can customise the name to your liking, you just need to change it in the code. it is not mandatory to use .jawa files since they don't even exist, but i suggest doing so for the time being, so that it is also recognisable from afar.

after all of that, you just run lua parser.lua which will run the file and also create a new file called out-file.lua, and yes, you do need to install lua.
